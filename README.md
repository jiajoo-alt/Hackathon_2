## Description of the game 
The Hungry Muse Restaurant

One day, after a tiring day from work, you unexpectedly received a letter from your grandpa. In the letter, he tells you that he is retiring soon and hopes that you will inherit his beloved restaurant. After thinking hard about it for a few days, you decide that it's time to step away from your hectic white-collar job and pick up your old passion: cooking. You return to your grandpa's place to continue his legacy and embark on an exciting culinary adventure.
In The Hungry Muse Restaurant, you will take on the role of a budding chef, tasked with running and managing your grandpa's restaurant. Your goal is to create a thriving dining establishment and earn a reputation as a masterful chef. Prepare to indulge your customers' taste buds with delectable dishes, experiment with new recipes, and create memorable dining experiences.
Each level presents a new challenge and culinary opportunity. For example, in Level 1, the scent of success fills the air as the tables quickly fill up. Your task is to prepare a total of 3 mouthwatering dishes to serve your eager customers. However, there's a twist - you won't be limited to a single dish. The menu boasts a delightful array of options, including Hamburger, Pizza, Taco, Bagel, and Pasta. Choose wisely to meet the quantity requirements for each customer, and remember that some of the ingredients can be repeated, allowing for creative combinations and flavors.
Put on your apron, sharpen your knives, and let your culinary adventure begin! As you progress through the game, you'll unlock new levels and face increasing challenges. Manage your resources effectively to satisfy your customers and earn their loyalty.
The Hungry Muse Restaurant offers an immersive experience with its engaging gameplay. Whether you're crafting gourmet dishes, managing your restaurant's finances you'll feel the thrill and excitement of the culinary world.
Are you ready to embrace your cooking legacy, honor your grandpa's restaurant, and create a dining destination that will leave a lasting impression on customers? Step into the kitchen, fire up the stove, and let your passion for cooking shine in The Hungry Muse Restaurant. Chef!
